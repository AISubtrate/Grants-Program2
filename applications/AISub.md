  - The platform also supports immediate reviews after using a model, enabling users to rate and leave detailed feedback on their experiences. These reviews will be stored on-chain and used for future model optimization and recommendation algorithms.
  - Users can manage and edit their review records. If they have new insights about a particular review, they can modify or add to their feedback at any time.

3. **User Interaction and Feedback**:
  - The user interface is not just a query tool; it also provides various ways for users to interact with the platform. Users can submit their opinions and suggestions through the interface or seek support when encountering issues.
  - Additionally, the user interface includes a dedicated feedback section that allows users to view other users' reviews and feedback on the same model, helping them make more informed decisions.

4. **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Based on user usage records and review data, the user interface automatically generates personalized AI model recommendations. The platform analyzes the user's historical usage, combined with model ratings and performance metrics, to recommend models that best meet their needs.
  - Users can also adjust the recommendation algorithm's preferences, choosing to prioritize high-performance models or cost-effective options, thereby achieving a more personalized recommendation experience.

5. **Model List Retrieval**:
  - Users can retrieve a list of available AI models through the user interface. Each model comes with detailed descriptions, including functionality, input format requirements, and estimated runtime, helping users make informed choices.
  - The model list supports various filtering criteria, such as model type, provider, and ratings, allowing users to quickly find the most suitable models for their needs.

6. **Model Execution and Result Retrieval**:
  - Users can initiate AI model execution requests directly from the user interface by following a specified JSON format. Users only need to input the required parameters, and the platform will automatically send the request to the blockchain and assign the appropriate model provider to handle it.
  - Once the model execution is complete, the user interface will automatically retrieve and display the results from the blockchain, ensuring transparency and data security throughout the process.
  - The platform offers real-time notifications, so users can be instantly notified when the model execution is complete and can view detailed execution results and related statistics.



#### Supplier Product Overview

![AISub_Timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AISubtrate/AIsubBuild/master/AISub_Supplierwork.jpg)


On the AISub platform, suppliers (model providers) can easily manage and publish their AI models through a specially designed interface and functional modules. Here are the key features available for suppliers:

1. **Create Model**:
  - Suppliers can create and publish new AI models through the platform. During model creation, suppliers need to provide detailed information about the model, such as model name, description, input/output format, intended use, etc.
  - The platform supports uploading model files or referencing external models via links, ensuring that suppliers can flexibly publish their model resources.
  - After creating a model, suppliers can choose whether to make it public (available to all users) or private (available to specific users only), catering to different application scenarios and privacy needs.
  - **When using open-source models**, suppliers must include the corresponding open-source license. This ensures compliance and respects the contributions of the open-source community. Suppliers must clearly specify the type of license used and upload the relevant license files to the platform during the model's publication.

2. **Create Version**:
  - To support continuous updates and improvements, the platform allows suppliers to create multiple versions of an already published model. Each version can have different enhancements and updates, with detailed records of the differences between versions.
  - When creating a new version, suppliers can describe the updates, improved features, and any changes that may impact model performance.
  - Users can choose to use a specific version of a model when invoking it, ensuring that they always have access to the version that best suits their needs.

3. **Pricing and Charging**:
  - Suppliers can set usage fees for their models. The platform offers various pricing strategies, allowing suppliers to set fees based on usage frequency, time, computational resources consumed, and other factors.
  - Suppliers can choose between fixed pricing or dynamic pricing models. Dynamic pricing allows for adjustments based on model demand and market conditions, enabling more flexible pricing strategies.
  - **When using open-source models**, suppliers must include the corresponding open-source license. This ensures compliance and respects the contributions of the open-source community. Suppliers must clearly specify the type of license used and upload the relevant license files to the platform during the model's publication.
  - All payments and revenue distributions will be handled through decentralized assets on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in transactions.

4. **Output Model Execution Results**:

When the milestones in the grant are completed, we will open source the entire project.
Our projects are open source based on GPL-3.0 license.

## Future Plans

1. We also plan to develop a Flutter version of the application, enabling users to access our services on more devices and platforms.
2. We aim to integrate cross-chain functionality, allowing users to use a wider range of assets to purchase AI services, thereby enhancing the availability and convenience of our services.
